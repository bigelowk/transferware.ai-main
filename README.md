“Shards are glass, sherds are pottery”

## Abstract

We introduce a system to help automate the dating of transferware sherds, a form of archaeological artifact commonly found in the Detroit area. This process is currently very manual, and uses experts' time that could be better spent elsewhere. This system will extend cutting edge computer vision research to develop a web system that will allow users to upload images of sherds, and return similar complete archelogical records from a nonprofit partners database. Challenges addressed include scalability, licensing, and more. This system is to be deployed to the nonprofit upon completion

## Structure
